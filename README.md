# Gateway Environment Testing Scenarios and Methods  

This repository focuses on implementing and testing various communication scenarios in gateway-like environments. These scenarios are designed to simulate and evaluate real-world automotive communication systems, leveraging open-source tools and libraries.  

## Current Scenarios  

### 1. DoCAN Implementation Using Python CAN  
The first scenario involves the implementation of Diagnostic Communication over CAN (DoCAN) based on the open-source `python-can` library. This setup serves as a foundational approach to simulate diagnostic communication, enabling features like message transmission, reception, and error handling in a gateway environment.  

Details about this implementation can be found in the [`python-can-tester`](./python-can-tester/README.md) folder.

## Project Structure  

- **`python-can-tester/`**  
  Contains the implementation details and examples for testing DoCAN communication scenarios using `python-can`. Refer to the [README](./pythoncantester/README.md) for a detailed guide.

- **`will be added more`**

Feel free to contribute by adding new scenarios or improving the existing implementations!
