# ISOTP Tester GUI

## Introduction
This project is focused on developing and maintaining a Python application designed to test and validate ISOTP (ISO 15765-2) communication over CAN (Controller Area Network). The primary goal is to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission in automotive and industrial applications.

## Features
- **ISOTP Communication**: Implement ISOTP protocol for sending and receiving messages over CAN.
- **PCAN Integration**: Utilize PCAN (Peak CAN) hardware and software for CAN communication.
- **Test Cases**: Predefined test cases to validate ISOTP message integrity and timing.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Detailed logging and reporting of test results for analysis.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `python-can`: For CAN communication.
  - `isotp`: For ISOTP protocol implementation.
- **Hardware**:
  - **PCAN**: Peak CAN hardware for physical layer communication.
